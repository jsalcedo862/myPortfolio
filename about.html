        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h3>Academics & Career:</h3>

        <p id="aboutme">Hello, thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio! My name is Juan Salcedo and
            I am a recent graduate at Montclair State University with a Bachelors in Computer Science.
            Currently, I am seeking a job in software or web development and working on projects on my own time that
            range from topics like audio plugin development, to web development and more. You can find my current
            projects on the Home page and the code for each project on the GitHub link above!
        </p>

        <h3>Hobbies:</h3>

        <p id="aboutme">
            On my down time, I enjoy working with music production software and hardware such as Ableton, Pro Tools,
            Logic, Synth & Effects plugins, Synth Hardware etc. I also enjoy living an active and healthy lifestyle by
            doing different forms of martial arts like Jiu-Jitsu & Muay Thai or other activities like Snowboarding,
            Hiking,
            running, and lifting weights.
        </p>

        <h3>Philosophies:</h3>
        <p id="aboutme">
            I believe in constantly striving to be the best version of myself. My decision to get a bachelors in
            Computer Science is similar to my decision to practice martial arts. I dont just believe in stepping
            out of your comfort zone, I believe in living there! Computer science to me was the perfect challenge of
            math, problem solving, and consistency. Martial arts is the perfect test of technique, perseverance, and
            character. The two are different but share many properties just like math requires mental technique, problem
            solivng requries perseverance and consistency requires character. This is the process of self development in
            all realms of life and it happens outside of our comfort zone, through hard work and dedication.
