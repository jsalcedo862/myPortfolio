                        by Building an Audio Plugin (w/ JUCE) - Full Course" provided in the link below. This was
                        my first time experimenting with the JUCE framework and my second time dealing with a large
                        project file. Some challenges I faced were mainly related to the code and making sure all
                        variables remained consistent. In the youtube course I chose to follow, you will notice this
                        is not the complete product. I decided this was a good stopping point so I can study the
                        code and get used to the workflow of building projects in JUCE.
