                        by Building an Audio Plugin (w/ JUCE) - Full Course" provided in the link below. This was
                        my first time experimenting with the JUCE framework and my second time dealing with a large
                        project file. Some challenges I faced were mainly related to the code and making sure all
                        variables remained consistent. In the YouTube course I chose to follow, you will notice this
                        is not the complete product. I decided this was a good stopping point so I can study the
                        code and get used to the workflow of building projects in JUCE.

                        Project: This project was developed using a course on Udemy "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by
                        Colt Steele. I used this course to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was designed to
                        test my JavaScript knowledge. The project code can be found in the course; however, to
                        best put
                        my skills to the test, I attempted to code this project on my own and only used the course as a
                        reference
                        when I got stuck. Some challenges I faced were related to JavaScript events and remembering
                        exactly
                        which one to use and when. Aside from that, this section of the course also introduced me to the
                        Bulma
                        CSS framework. Overall, it was a fun project and very insightful.
